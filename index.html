	I am currently a <a data-url="https://burkeinstitute.caltech.edu/people/postdoctoral-fellows" href="https://burkeinstitute.caltech.edu/people/postdoctoral-fellows" target="_blank" title="">DuBridge Postdoctoral Scholar</a>&nbsp;at the Walter Burke Institute for&nbsp;Theoretical Physics&nbsp;at Caltech, supervised by <a data-url="http://theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/" href="http://theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/" target="_blank" title="">John Preskill</a>.

	I received my PhD in Physics from Harvard University under the guidance of&nbsp;<a data-url="https://lukin.physics.harvard.edu/" href="https://lukin.physics.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" title="">Mikhail&nbsp;Lukin</a>. Previously, I obtained&nbsp;my BSc in Physics and Mathematics at MIT.<br><br>My research interests are at the interface of physics and computer science, touching on many topics in quantum information theory, quantum&nbsp;optics, and many-body physics. My contributions include analyzing&nbsp;quantum algorithms and architectures,&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;proving fundamental results&nbsp;in quantum complexity theory. I also work closely with experimentalists to develop practical schemes of quantum applications for current and near-term experimental implementations.
